Architecture Decision Records. 
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architectural_decision#Templates


Architecture decisions are dependent on the context of the project.

Architecture decisions are *subjective* - they are based on opinion.
Treat everything you read in an ADR as an opinion unless citations are provided.
In this way, we avoid the need to write "In my opinion" and "I think" all the 
time.
