Decision: use the Gradle intellij plugin instead of the IntelliJ plugin dev kit.

This is a given for me:

* Gradle is my preferred personal build tool
* it mostly avoids the need to configure the dev machine for building the plugin
* easy to integrate the plugin into projects that use Gradle
* I can't find it, but I thought I read somewhere the gradle plugin was the
  "blessed" way to build plugins now
