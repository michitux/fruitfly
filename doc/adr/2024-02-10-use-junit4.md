Decision: Use the JUnt 4 framework.

Plugins can allegedly be tested with any framework:
https://plugins.jetbrains.com/docs/intellij/tests-and-fixtures.html

I am most familiar with JUnit and it's the popular community choice.
There's no compelling reason to use a different framework.

But for plugin testing, there's actually three choices of JUnit version:
* JUnit 4
  * project is very stale
  * it's what the IDEA plugin devkit testing framework is built around
* JUnit 5
  * the current version
  * not abandoned
  * not used much by the IDEA team (at least, no extant examples)

I'd prefer JUnit 5, but I'm going with what the plugin devkit uses by default
