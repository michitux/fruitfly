Decision: use the short identifier "fruitfly" to identify the code

People often argue that package, groups names etc. should always use a fully
qualified domain name.

Given that I'm not going to register a domain name for this project, folks might
suggest something like: `com.github.shorn.fruitfly`.

Sometimes a fully qualified domain name is the right choice, but often it just
causes unnecessary verbosity and tedium - i.e. empty package directories, 
etc.

In this case, the fruitfly identifier is not going to clash with anything. 

So the group identifier, packages names, etc. are just going to be `fruitfly`.
