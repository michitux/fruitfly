 An example of some of the dodgier kind of code I write when I'm in a hurry
 where I just band the record in next to the class I'm working on.
 If it lives for a while, it'll generally get refactored to the top level
 pretty quickly.
 The point being: the generator should work find for structures that aren't
 just simple single class files.
